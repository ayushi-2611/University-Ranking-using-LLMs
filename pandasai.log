def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary

    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart save it to an image in temp_chart.png and do not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)

    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart save it to an image in temp_chart.png and do not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:

User 1: Give me the  numerical columns correlated to each other with correlation greater than 0.7, please give with which column they are corelated and what is the correlation coefficient?

This is the initial python code to be updated:
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart save it to an image in temp_chart.png and do not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": "The highest salary is $9,000." }

User 1: What are the ML models you will suggest to make a predictive model to predict the rank or change in rank using the data
</conversation>

This is the initial python code to be updated:
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart save it to an image in temp_chart.png and do not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": "The highest salary is $9,000." }

    Analyze the data
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart save it to an image in temp_chart.png and do not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)

        { "type": "string", "value": "The highest salary is $9,000." }
