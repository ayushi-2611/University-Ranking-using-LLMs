The project aimed to develop a predictive model focused on forecasting the ranking of universities within the FT (Financial Times) ranking system. The primary objective centered on creating a predictive algorithm to anticipate a university's placement in the rankings. Specifically, our team refined this objective to concentrate on predicting whether a university could secure a position within the top 30 rankings in the FT Times Ranking. To achieve this, we employed a CatBoost binary classifier that provided a binary outcomeâ€”1 indicating the university's likelihood of securing a top 30 ranking and 0 signifying otherwise.

Throughout the project, our focus remained on harnessing machine learning techniques, data analysis, and predictive modeling to assess and predict the potential rankings of universities. By leveraging the CatBoost algorithm and meticulous data analysis, our team strived to provide valuable insights that could aid universities in understanding the factors influencing their rankings and potentially improve their positioning within the prestigious FT ranking system.
